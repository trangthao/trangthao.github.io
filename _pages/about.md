* ["Bank Expansion, Firm Performance and Gender Gaps: Evidence from Vietnam"]().
  * Expansion of bank branches has played a pivotal role in enhancing financial development and access to finance. Using firm-level and district-level data from Vietnam during 2007 - 2019, we document that (1) increased bank expansion has a positive impact on a firm's revenue and number of employees, but not on labor productivity; and (2) this result is driven by men-led firms, while for women-led firms, we find no effects on firms' sales, employment and labor productivity. This might be because men-led firms have a higher probability of getting loans compared to women-led firms with increased exposure to banks. Another interesting result is that if firms get loans, women-led firms have a higher probability of adopting modern technologies, such as cloud computing technology, advanced robots, and additive manufacturing technology (3D printing), with an increase in exposure to banks. Our results highlight the importance of bank expansion in increasing firms' performance in developing countries, but suggest more policies in supporting women-led firms in accessing to banks, apart from increasing the number of bank branches.
