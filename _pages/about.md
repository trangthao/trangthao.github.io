* ["Bank Expansion, Firm Performance and Gender Gaps: Evidence from Vietnam"]().
  * Expansion of bank branches has played a pivotal role in enhancing financial development and access to finance. Using firm-level and district-level data from Vietnam during 2007 - 2019, we document that (1) increased bank expansion has a positive impact on a firm's revenue and number of employees, but not on labor productivity; and (2) this result is driven by men-led firms, while for women-led firms, we find no effects on firms' sales, employment and labor productivity. This might be because men-led firms have a higher probability of getting loans compared to women-led firms with increased exposure to banks. Another interesting result is that if firms get loans, women-led firms have a higher probability of adopting modern technologies, such as cloud computing technology, advanced robots, and additive manufacturing technology (3D printing), with an increase in exposure to banks. Our results highlight the importance of bank expansion in increasing firms' performance in developing countries, but suggest more policies in supporting women-led firms in accessing to banks, apart from increasing the number of bank branches.

* [Special Economic Zones and Firm Performance: Evidence from Vietnamese Firms](). 
  * This paper seeks to answer whether SEZs help to promote spillovers from multinational firms to firms by increasing firms performance. We focus on the role of SEZs in creating spillovers to firms in the host country. We focus on firms operating in Vietnam from 2007-2019, and the information on SEZs of Vietnam. Our dataset allows us to track different dimensions to check for heterogeneity, including types of SEZs, firm sizes, industries, and especially firm types: whether they are foreign, private domestic or domestic state. We also establish a unique linkage between many multinational firms and their subsidiaries in Vietnam, and then with domestic firms inside and outside special economic zones. The dataset allows us to track tax identification numbers of the firms, and to check their names to match them with international datasets, like Orbis and ASEAN WIPO to observe additional details on their innovation efforts (like patents) or other investment/ financial information 1. We use four measures to measure firm performance. To measure firm size, we use log number of employees, and log total sales. To measure productivity, we use labour productivity and TFP. Prior to SEZ establishment, we find no difference between SEZ firms and non-SEZ firms conditional on 2-digit sector and province, and using sample of firms from 2007-2019, and removing firms treated in the first year of the sample (2007). After entering into SEZs, direct effects are observed - firms in SEZs show an increase in their sales and labor productivity. We then check for spillover effects for firms located in communes with SEZs (not accounting for firms in SEZ areas), and heterogenous effects by types of SEZs, types of firms, firm size, and industries. For spillover effects, we see a positive effect 1 year after SEZ establishment for firms located in the same commune with SEZs (increase by 11%). We do not see any effects for number of employees, labour productivity and TFP after SEZ establishment. For heterogeneous effects, we see an increase in productivity for firms located in industrial parks as well as large firms. Foreign-owned firms show an increase in sales, and manufacturing firms show an increase in both sales and labor productivity.
